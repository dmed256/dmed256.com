Howdy, my name is David Medina!

I currently work at **Harvest** as a Senior Software Engineer, where I lead the Infrastructure and Services team.
At night I work as a contractor with the **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory** with the [Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations](http://ceed.exascaleproject.org/).

When not spending time with family, I'm usually coding up some project :)

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in chatting!
